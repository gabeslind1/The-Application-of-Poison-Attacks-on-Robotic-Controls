# The-Application-of-Poison-Attacks-on-Robotic-Controls

This project contains files used in the USNA Cyber Capstone 2024 project of the same name as listed above. The collaborators of this project are Jeff Edwards, Alex Gannon, Gabriel Slind, and Josh Temeles. The simulation used for this project was part of Oude Vrielink, Jeoren's work (2021), which was further built off of the network proposed by Kumra et al. (2020).

The three main programs in this repository, are killer.py, killerv2.py, and killerv3.py. Each program is a different attack on the UR5 simulation and are described in our paper which is linked below.
